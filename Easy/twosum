the easiest way to do this would be a hashmap. I had done this previously before I took data structures and did it brute force, but that isn't very cool.
updated solution:
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        previousMap = {} #val : index
        for i,n in enumerate(nums):
            difference = target - n
            if difference in previousMap:
                return[previousMap[difference], i]
            previousMap[n] = i #if we don't find, upate the hashmap
